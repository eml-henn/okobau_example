# plugin reads a list of queries from a database - eg all walls with structural amterial = STB
# plugin reads a list of assemblies mapped to the list of queries - eg query above -> reinforced concrete wall (assembly)

# plugin reads from assembly which quantity value needs to be read from the elements in revit - eg volume
# plugin generate a new assembly instance from the assembly catalogue and assigns the read quantity of the elements to the quantity property of the assembly 
# plugin writes all the IDs of revit elements to the results property of the assembly
# plugin reads from assembly which parts are making up that assembly
# plugin reads from the parts which unit the part needs and convert if necessary
# plugin reads from the epd in the part which environmental indicators we calculate
# plugin create a new parts instance and assign it to the assembly instanceÂ´s parts collection
# plugin writes the results values based on the assembly quantity in the epds for all parts in the parts collection of the assembly
